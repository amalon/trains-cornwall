I've tried to use free sources wherever possible. The originals can be found in
the originals/ directory. Modifications can be found in the modified/ directory.

 - The graphics on the sea are taken from publicdomainvectors.org in SVG form
   and are claimed to be in the public domain.

   The only changes are colour changes.

 - The maps of Cornwall [1] and the Isles of Scilly [2] are taken from
   wikipedia, and are derived from Ordinance Survey OpenData.

   They have been simplified using Inkscape and the colours have been altered.
   They are then used as the background maps for the board and the destination
   tickets.

 - The flags of Cornwall [3], Devon [4], the the United
   States of America [5] are taken from wikipedia, and are placed in the public
   domain.

   They have been modified to make them circular.
   They are then used as the icons for the towns and cities on the board and the
   destination tickets.

 - The flag of the Isles of Scilly [6] was taken from wikipedia, and is licensed
   under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England & Wales
   license.

   It has been modified to make it circular, with the stars moved so they remain
   visible.
   It is then used as the icons for the islands on the board and the destination
   tickets.

 - The image of a locomotive [7] was taken from wikipedia, and is licensed under
   the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported, and 2.5 Generic,
   2.0 Generic, & 1.0 Generic licenses.

   The outline has been traced.
   It is then used as the locomotives on ferry routes on the board, and in the
   table of scores for different route lengths on the board.
