Prerequisites
-------------

You need the "Kaushan Script Regular" font installed from fontlibrary.org:

  https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/kaushan-script

Install Inkscape and ensure it is in the $PATH.

Install pdfposter and ensure pdfposter is in the $PATH:

  https://gitlab.com/pdftools/pdfposter.git


Building
--------

The default Makefile targets generate a tiled A4 PDF of the board in
outputs/Cornwall-300dpi-a4.pdf:

$ make

To open cornwall_tickets.svg you first need to generate the background from
ticket_background.svg. This can be done with the "prepare" Makefile target:

$ make prepare

Other Makefile targets are as follows (where XX is the DPI, either 75, 150, or
300):

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi.png
   A PNG of the board at the specified DPI.

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi.pdf
   A single page PDF of the board at the specified DPI.

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi-a4.pdf
   A tiled multipage PDF of the board at the specified DPI, for A4 printing.


Sources
-------

I've tried to use free sources wherever possible. The originals can be found in
the originals/ directory. Modifications can be found in the modified/ directory.

 - The graphics on the sea are taken from publicdomainvectors.org in SVG form
   and are claimed to be in the public domain.

   The only changes are colour changes.

 - The maps of Cornwall [1] and the Isles of Scilly [2] are taken from
   wikipedia, and are derived from Ordinance Survey OpenData.

   They have been simplified using Inkscape and the colours have been altered.
   They are then used as the background maps for the board and the destination
   tickets.

 - The flags of Cornwall [3], Devon [4], the the United
   States of America [5] are taken from wikipedia, and are placed in the public
   domain.

   They have been modified to make them circular.
   They are then used as the icons for the towns and cities on the board and the
   destination tickets.

 - The flag of the Isles of Scilly [6] was taken from wikipedia, and is licensed
   under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England & Wales
   license.

   It has been modified to make it circular, with the stars moved so they remain
   visible.
   It is then used as the icons for the islands on the board and the destination
   tickets.

 - The image of a locomotive [7] was taken from wikipedia, and is licensed under
   the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported, and 2.5 Generic,
   2.0 Generic, & 1.0 Generic licenses.

   The outline has been traced.
   It is then used as the locomotives on ferry routes on the board, and in the
   table of scores for different route lengths on the board.

 - Most of the text uses the "Kaushan Script Regular" [8] font, released under
   the OFL (SIL Open Font License).
