Prerequisites
-------------

You need the following fonts installed:

 - "Kaushan Script Regular" from fontlibrary.org:
   https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/kaushan-script

 - "Anton" from Google:
   https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton

Inkscape is required by the Makefile to convert the SVG files to PNG. Install
it (at least version 1) and ensure it is in the $PATH:

  https://inkscape.org/

Imagemagick is required by the Makefile to convert the PNG to a PDF. Install it
and ensure the "convert" utility is in the $PATH:

  https://www.imagemagick.org/

Pdfposter and TeX Live (pdflatex) are required by the Makefile to tile the
large PDF onto multiple pages and add cropping marks. Install them and ensure
pdfposter and pdflatex are in the $PATH:

  https://gitlab.com/pdftools/pdfposter.git
  https://tug.org/texlive/


Building
--------

The default Makefile targets generate a tiled A4 PDF of the board in
outputs/Cornwall-300dpi-a4.pdf, and a paged set of destination tickets in
outputs/cornwall_tickets-300dpi.pdf:

$ make

To open cornwall_tickets.svg you first need to generate the background from
ticket_background.svg. This can be done with the "prepare" Makefile target:

$ make prepare

Other Makefile targets are as follows (where XX is the DPI, either 75, 150, or
300):

 - all
   All outputs at all DPI levels.

 - board
   Just the board PDF at the default DPI level.

 - tickets
   Just the tickets PDF at the default DPI level.

 - png
   PNG files for each of the above DPI levels.

 - pdf
   PDF files of the above PNG files and corresponding A4 tiles for printing.

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi.png
   A PNG of the board at the specified DPI.

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi.pdf
   A single page PDF of the board at the specified DPI.

 - outputs/Cornwall-XXdpi-a4.pdf
   A tiled multipage PDF of the board at the specified DPI, for A4 printing.

 - 1-4: The graphics on the sea ([1], [2], [3], [4]) are taken from
   publicdomainvectors.org in SVG form and are claimed to be in the public
   domain.

   The only changes are colour changes to the lighthouse ([3]) and the ship
   ([4]).

 - 5-7: The flags of Cornwall [5], Devon [6], and the United States of America
   [7] are taken from wikipedia, and are placed in the public domain.

   They have been modified to make them circular.
   They are then used as the icons for the towns and cities on the board and the
   destination tickets.

 - 8-11: The map of Cornwall [8], the map of the Isles of Scilly [9], the flag
   of the Isles of Scilly [10] and the image of a locomotive [11] are taken
   from wikipedia, and are licensed under the Creative Commons
   Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.

   The maps have been simplified using Inkscape and the colours have been
   altered. They are then used as the background maps for the board and the
   destination tickets.

   The flag of the Isles of Scilly has been modified to make it circular, with
   the stars moved so they remain visible.
   It is then used as the icons for the islands on the board and the destination
   tickets.

   The outline of the locomotive has been traced.
   It is then used as the locomotives on ferry routes on the board, and in the
   table of scores for different route lengths on the board.

 - 12-13: Most of the text uses the "Kaushan Script Regular" [12] font, but the
   scores on the tickets use the "Anton" [13] font. Both are released under the
   OFL (SIL Open Font License).
